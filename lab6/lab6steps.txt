Minix Setup, Kernel Modification, and Compilation Guide

I. Setting Up Minix in VirtualBox

1. Access the ECC Linux Systems (for SCU students, if required):
      - Use NoMachine to connect to an ECC Linux system with GUI support.
      - Use the connection format linux215<>.dc.engr.scu.edu, replacing <> with numbers from 01 to 24.

2. Open VirtualBox:
      - On ECC or your local machine, open a terminal and type:
          bash
          virtualbox
          
      - Or open VirtualBox from Activities > Show Applications if you are on a graphical interface.

3. Configure Network in VirtualBox:
      - Go to Tools > Networks > Host-only Networks > Create.
      - Enable DHCP server in the properties and apply the settings to create vboxnet0.

4. Import the Minix Image:
      - Go to File > Import Appliance in VirtualBox.
      - Select /local/Vbox/minix3-1-7.ova (or your downloaded Minix file).
      - In Settings, ensure MAC Address Policy is set to "Generate new MAC addresses for all network adapters."
      - Click Finish to complete the import.

5. Setup Network Adapter:
      - Select your imported Minix VM, go to Settings > Network.
      - Set Adapter 1 to Host-only Adapter, and choose vboxnet0 as Name.

6. Start the Minix VM:
      - Boot up Minix by selecting Start.
      - Login as root (no password initially).
      - Set a password for root by typing:
          bash
          passwd

II. Accessing Files in Minix

1. Find the Minix IP Address:
      - Inside the Minix terminal, type:
          bash
          ifconfig
          
      - Note down the IP address displayed, which you'll use to connect via FTP.

2. Start the FTP Daemon:
      - Enable FTP on Minix for file transfer:
          bash
          tcpd ftp in.ftpd &
          
      
3. Connect to Minix Files from the Host System:
      - GUI Access:
          - In your file browser on the host, go to Other Locations.
          - In Connect to Server, type:
              plaintext
              ftp://<Minix_IP>
              
              Replace <Minix_IP> with the actual IP address.
      - Terminal Access:
          - Open a terminal on the host system.
          - Type:
              bash
              ftp <Minix_IP>
              
              Log in using your Minix username and password.

III. Modifying the Kernel Boot Message

1. Locate the Boot Message File:
      - Use grep to search for the boot message text in Minix:
          bash
          grep "Copyright /usr/src/*/*
          

2. Edit the Boot Message File:
      - Once you locate the file, you can edit it using a text editor.
      - Add your name or a custom message to the boot-up message line.
      - Example of a message modification:
          c
          printf("Welcome to Minix - YourName CSEN 177\n");

IV. Recompiling the Minix Kernel

1. Navigate to the Source Directory:
      - Change to the /usr/src directory, which contains Minix's kernel source code:
          bash
          cd /usr/src
          

2. Compile the Kernel with make world:
      - Type the following command to rebuild Minix with your modifications:
          bash
          make world
          
      - This process may take some time as it recompiles the entire system.

3. Reboot Minix:
      - After recompilation, reboot Minix to load the modified kernel:
          bash
          shutdown
          
      - Alternatively, you can use reboot to restart without fully powering down.

4. Verify the Changes:
      - When Minix restarts, look for your modified boot message during startup to confirm that your changes took effect.

V. Troubleshooting and Resetting Minix (if needed)

- If Minix Fails to Boot:
      - Re-import the Minix VM in VirtualBox:
          - Go to File > Import Appliance and select the Minix image file again.
          - Follow the previous steps to set up the network adapter and boot Minix.
      - If files were corrupted, you may need to start fresh with a clean copy of Minix by re-importing.
