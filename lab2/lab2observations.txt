Step 3:
- The parent and children processes take turns running and printing out.
- The child or parent process will run for loop twice in a row without waiting for the other to run occasionally (I observed this happening thrice).

Step 4:
(With a 3000 microsecond delay)
- The program ran similar to how it did in Step 3.
- The child or parent process will run for loop twice in a row without waiting for the other to run occasionally (I observed this happening thrice). This occured during later cycles in the program.
(With a 500 microsecond delay)
- The program runs without the child or parent process printing out twice in a row.
(With a 5000 microsecond delay)
- The program runs with 1 instance when the parent process runs twice in a row.

Step 6:
- The program ran as expected with a delay of 500 microseconds.
- Without the delay, the program failed to run and returned a segmentation fault.

Step 7:
- The program ran as expected with a delay of 500 microseconds.
- Without the delay, the program failed to run and returned a segmentation fault.
